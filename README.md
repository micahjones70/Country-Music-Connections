Tennessee Tech CSC 2310 'Object Oriented Programing' Semester Project Fall 2022

# About
Semester Long Project for Dr Gannod's Fall 2022 OOP class. This project works in 
creating connections between artists and any collaborations they have done with other
artists. The project uses discogs API to pull data for each artist on the graph and
creates a dictionary object accordingly. We made it to where you can add artists to
the graph and see their collaborations given that you manualy add the info if it cannot
be found on Discogs.

# Structure
I have created branches for each iteration as well as including the concept iterations.
UML class diagrams were used to graph out each part of the code and all their needed 
functions. These can be found in the "Concept Initiate" branches.

# P.S.
This project is far from refined and has many improvements that can be made. I plan to
add more of my ideas to the project in the future.
